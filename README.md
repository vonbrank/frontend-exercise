This is a series of designs and implementations of some tech webpages for front-end development exercises.

## Getting Started

Each of the webpages may use different technology stacks to build.

| Name          | Technology Stack   | URL                                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Main          | Markdown           | [Front-end Exercises](https://github.com/vonbrank/frontend-exercises) |
| One More Clip | React.js           | [再来一条文化](https://blog.vonbrank.com/frontend-exercises/onemoreclip/) |
| Omnifood      | Vanilla JavaScript | N/A                                                          |

Take *One More Clip* for example :

+ Go into the directory of it:

  ```bash
  cd ./onemoreclip
  ```

+ Setup the Node.js project:

  ```bash
  npm install
  # or 
  yarn install
  ```

+ Run the development server:

  ```bash
  npm run start
  # or 
  yarn start
  ```

+ Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to preview the result. 

## Learn More

Most parts of the project will probably be driven by React.js, and some of them may be built by Vue.js. To learn more about such web front-end development frameworks, you can visit :
